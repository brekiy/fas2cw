# Firearms Source 2: CW 2.0 Edition

Port of the FAS:2 SWEPs put out by spy and others to the newer CW 2.0 base. Maintains most of the original aesthetic with some new stuff and overrides of CW 2.0 functionality.

No c_hands and limited bodygroup hacking because I still suck at Blender. If you want that stuff there's a very good ArcCW conversion of FAS:2 SWEPs on the workshop already.
