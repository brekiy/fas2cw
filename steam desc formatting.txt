[h1]Firearms: Source 2 Weapons for CW2[/h1]
This is a port of the FA:S 2 weapons from the original base to CW2 with some extras. They've been updated with bodygroup hacks, extra attachments, and tweaked sounds. To run this you also need to subscribe to the [CW] FA:S 2 base I've listed as a dependency.

[*] Spy - CW2 base, original FA:S 2 SWEP pack
[*] Robert F., Joni, sweg m@ster - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462119296]FA:S 2 expansion[/url]
[*] FA:S Team - All models/animations/textures/sound from the FA:S project.
[*] modelistmax, 4Echo, Mr. Brightside, Navaro, JOK3R - [url=https://gamebanana.com/mods/208554]KAC PDW[/url] model.
[*] Mazima Gofo - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232599274]Guide to writing QCIs[/url]. Without this I wouldn't have been able to set up the original models for c-hand usage.
[*] 8Z - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2136192016]Guide to creating ArcCW SWEPs[/url]. Completely different base but the Blender section is a good read for anyone looking to get into 3D modelling/animation.
[*] Fesiug - General inspiration from the excellent ArcCW pack of FA:S 2 weapons. Got ideas for caliber conversions from there.
[*] Me (brekiy) - Bodygroup chopping, (very) minor animating, code, audio editing, everything else.
